# Human-Robot Priming

## Matlab

   The Human-Robot Priming project was designed into two parts: subject trials and data collection. For the subject trials, the subjects are first shown a screen showing the instructions for the trials. The subjects are then shown an image of a human or robot at the center of the screen for two seconds. Then, the picture is replaced with a word at the center of the screen. The subjects’ task is to press “1” on their keyboard if they think the word is real. If they think the word is not a real world, they are asked to press “0”. Additionally, each experiment randomizes the trials so they are in a different order for each subject. 

   For the data collection part of the experiment, the subject’s responses were recorded in order to do further analysis. For each experiment, the words, category (positive, negative, neutral, or nonwords), type of image, response, response time, and accuracy were recorded. Moreover, only the responses that were correct were analyzed because the purpose of the experiment is to determine if priming a subject with an image of a robot vs. an image of a human affects the reaction time and accuracy for different categories of words.
